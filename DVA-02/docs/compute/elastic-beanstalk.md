## Key Characteristics

### All at Once

- Deploys to all instances simultaneously
- Fastest but highest risk
- Best for dev/test environments
- Has downtime during deployment

### Rolling

- Updates instances in batches
- Reduced capacity during deployment
- Some instances serve old version while others new
- Good for production with acceptable partial degradation

### Rolling with Additional Batch

- Like rolling but launches new instances first
- Maintains full capacity
- Takes longer but safer
- Good for production requiring full capacity

### Immutable

- Launches new instances with new version
- Zero downtime and quick rollback
- More expensive (double capacity temporarily)
- Safest for production

### Blue/Green

- Creates entirely new environment
- Zero downtime and instant rollback
- Most expensive (double capacity until swap)
- Best for critical production applications
- Requires DNS change (Route 53)

## Best Practices

- Dev/Test: Use All at Once for speed
- Production (cost-sensitive): Use Rolling with Additional Batch
- Production (critical): Use Immutable or Blue/Green
- Always test deployment policy in dev/test environment first
