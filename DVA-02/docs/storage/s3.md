# Replication data in S3

- S3 lifecycle actions are not replicated. User must configure lifecycle rules in destination bucket.
- Same Region Replication (SRR) and Cross-Region Replication (CRR) supported at S3 bucket level

# Encryption in S3

- SSE-S3 (AES-256 managed by S3):
  - AWS fully manages keys.

You have no control over key creation, rotation, or deletion.

Easiest, but not suited here since you want control.

SSE-KMS (AWS KMS keys)

Keys are managed by AWS KMS.

Two types:

AWS managed keys (aws/s3): minimal control.

Customer managed CMKs (customer created keys): you create keys, set rotation policy, and remove them when needed.

Fits your requirement.

SSE-C (Customer-provided keys)

You manage and provide your own encryption keys.

AWS does not store keys.

More complex key lifecycle management. Not AWS managed.

Client-side encryption

You encrypt before uploading.

AWS does not manage keys.

Full responsibility on your side.
